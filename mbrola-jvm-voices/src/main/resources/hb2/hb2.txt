1.0 Description of the HB2 diphone database
--------------------------------------------------------------

HB2 is a diphone database  for  Hebrew, Israeli accent, consisting of 1008 diphones, female voice.

The following  phoneme  symbols are  used in recording  the database. 
They follow the SAMPA standard (http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/hebrew.htm) with the exception of Ts (parallel to the SAMPA ts). 

Following are the symbols and Hebrew words which include the respective sounds.
_       silence

Vowels: 
a	tan
e	tel
i	tik
o	tor
u	tur
ai	xai
ei	mei
oi	goi
ui	Satui

Consonants:
?	?ani
b	bor
g	gol
d	dor
h	har
v	vav
z	zer
X	Xor
t	tor
j	jom
k	kad
l	lul
m	mul

Consonants used in foreign words:
Z	masaZ
tS	tSips
dZ	dZins
N	baN

Limitations: 
----------- 
The diphone matrix includes a large number of rare diphones that occur only in foreign words.  Their appearance in Hebrew discourse is limited, yet we assumed that their inclusion would allow us to work freely with texts of journalistic nature or those pertaining to everyday speech, in which the use of such words is quite common.  The database does not account for the "Sephardic" pronunciation of guggurals, and consonant-w/w-consonant diphones are currently not accounted for.
