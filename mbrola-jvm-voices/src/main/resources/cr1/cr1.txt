1.0 Description of  CR1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CR1 is first version of a diphone database for Croatian. It includes 930
diphones.

The following phoneme symbols are assumed in our diphone set: 

Note: This set uses the SAMPA notation for Croatian. In the representation
      of Croatian orthography shown below, 

   * c' stands for c with an acute accent;
   * d' stands for a barred d;
   * c^ s^ z^ stand for c s z with a wedge accent (hacek).


Vowels. There are five vowels in Croatian. Additionally, r can function as
a vowel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 Installation and Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not copied the MBROLA software yet, please consult
the MBROLA project homepage and get it. Also refer to the readme.txt file
provided with the mbrola software for using it.

Copy cr1.zip into the mbrola directory and unzip it.

Try 

   mbrola cr1 zalostan.pho zalostan.wav

to create a sound file for the word /Zalostan/ (sad). Listen to it with
your favorite sound editor, and try the other command files (*.pho) to
have a better idea of the quality of speech that can be synthesized with
MBROLA and the cr1 database.

In the creation of new *.pho files, there is no need  to worry about
allophones. They are included in the database by allowing natural
assimilation in the course of pronunciation. You need simply write the
phonemic (SAMPA) transcription in the *.pho file.

The cr1 database was developed in Department of  Phonetics at University
of Zagreb.

We would like to thank Vincent Pagel for his efforts in converting our
diphone database to the MBROLA format and for all suggestions during the
construction and transfer of the database. Also, we would like to thank
to all students of phonetics who took part in the construction of the
database.
